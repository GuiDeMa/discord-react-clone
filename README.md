# Discord React Clone

![Preview](https://i.imgur.com/0UpCir4.gif)

This project is a front-end replication of Discord's app made with React. This is not a full replication so I added the most used parts of the app.

The main objective of this project was to learn `styled-components` so this is the only library utilized (aside from `normalize.css`).

Some observations:
* The styled scrollbars only work on webkit-based browsers
* As it is a front-end only project, all the data is mocked in a single file

## Running the project

    npm start
    # or
    yarn start

This will run the app in development mode, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
